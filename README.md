## Why I Find This Interesting

This article I covered in a previous course is interesting because, even though it was written in 1986, many of its core ideas still apply directly to modern software development. Brooks argues that there is no single technology or process improvement that will magically solve the inherent complexity of building software. Instead, most of the difficulty comes from the *essential complexity* of software itself — the fact that software must precisely model complex real-world systems and requirements.

What stands out to me is how relevant this perspective remains despite massive advances in tooling, languages, and infrastructure. Even with cloud platforms, AI-assisted coding, and modern frameworks, teams still struggle with unclear requirements, changing user needs, and system complexity. The article is a good reminder that while tools can help, thoughtful design, communication, and problem-solving are still the most important skills in software engineering.

Thus, great software extends past just writing code faster: it’s about managing complexity, making good trade-offs, and understanding the problem deeply.

## Comment
(*Sheldon Xie cx2275*) In this age of merging LLMs and Agentic coding, Brooks, almost prophetically, warns us that **AI does not dissolve the essence of software**. The hardist parts - dealing with conflicting requirements, modeling complecated domains and problems, handling ambiguity, etc. - are still human's works and requires the proper engineering skills. At the end of the day, AI is not the *silver bullet* but tool that can help us express ideas more efficiently, but it cannot replace the hard work of thinking — understanding, specifying, and designing software that reflects complex human needs.
